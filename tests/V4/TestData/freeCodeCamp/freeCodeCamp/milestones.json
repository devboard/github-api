We plan to coordinate the creation of these challenges completely on GitHub (no Trello this time).\r\n\r\nFor each challenge we need a set of agile user stories and a working demo (should minimize the number of tools from outside those covered in our curriculum) - on CodePen for Ziplines, and on Heroku/GitHub for full stack challenges",

User \"Clicks Save Solution to GitHub\" button (available only when logged in)\r\n2. If Save button is clicked for first time (Setup the GitHub)\r\n    i. Go through the steps of requesting additional permissions (write access to repository).\r\n    ii. Create a repo \"Free-Code-Camp-Solutions\" (ask user for a name, store it in user object)\r\n    iii. Create a new file for each challenge \"Challenge-Name-Solution-Submission-Date-Time.md\" (let's keep it markdown).\r\n3. If Setup the GitHub is done,\r\n    i. Add a new file as shown above.\r\n    ii. If submitting a second time, that date/time stamped file will automatically handle such scenarios for us.\r\n\r\nLet's keep this flow as simple as we can, we do not need separate challenge category folders to avoid handling renaming them each time our curriculum changes, also we would want campers to be able to save multiple edition of their solutions (time stamped versioned files), so that the on us is on them to delete/keep them later in their repository.",

Free Code Camp lost my data!\"\r\n\r\n99% of the time, what actually happened is that the camper originally signed in with one auth option (Facebook) and forgot which option they used and signed in with another, accidentally creating a duplicate account.\r\n\r\nIn order to prevent this frustrating misunderstanding from happening, we'd like to reduce our auth options to just two: email and GitHub.\r\n\r\nAnd while we're at it, we'd like to get rid of passwords and at the same time prevent people from using fake email addresses (which can result in accounts that can't be recovered without special help).\r\n\r\nThe way we plan to do this is to do what Twitter and Slack are now doing and send an email with a link that logs a camper in directly. This way, they don't have to remember a password, and their password can't be cracked so it is in theory much more secure.\r\n\r\nOur road map for doing this transition is:\r\n1) Separate the \"log in\" and the \"create an account\" actions into two separate views.\r\n2) When a user signs in with an email address for the first time, we ask for a password. Then we tell them we need to verify their email before they can go on, and give them an opportunity to change their email address in case they used a fake one before.\r\n3) When a returning user signs in with an auth option other than GitHub or email, we explain that we are removing the old auth options and force them to verify an email address before they can progress.\r\n4) After a while, we change the log in page to have a \"if you originally signed in with a different service, click here\" and that takes people to the old sign in page, where they can sign in with one of those services and verify their email.\r\n\r\nThis should ultimately make FCC more secure for everyone and more convenient for the majority of people who are bad with passwords.",
